### Face Assistant
**Role** | Product Manager, Backend Developer <br>
**Technologies** | Go, Python, OpenFace, scikit-learn, Docker, AWS, Java,
Android APIs
<br><br>
Face Assistant is an application for Android and Google Glass that I worked on
with two classmates for CCNY's Computer Science Capstone Course. The
application uses [OpenFace](http://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/), a facial
recognition implementation, to help
those who have prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness, identify their loved
ones easier.

### Automated Passenger Counting System
**Role** | Lead Developer<br>
**Technologies** | C#, .Net, Go, ZeroMQ, AWS
<br><br>
The Automated Passenger Counting System(APC) was the project I worked on during my
internship at MTA. The system consolidated real-time counts of passengers on buses
which is stored into a database for use by other departments.
Parts of the system include:

- .NET application which interfaces with the APC sensors to retrieve counts
- REST API in the backend used to store and retrieve counts from a database
- A queue that publishes the incoming count data from the buses to other applications for consumption
- Prototype bus load calculator which takes the data from the queue and calculates the
  load on the buses for customers to see on the BusTime app.
